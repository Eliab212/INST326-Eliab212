I used created a journal text file in github now this week we are 
using ai to explain python and even use ai to help us correct our code
and also use ai to give us ideas for different ways of writing our code.

This week I got a deep understanding of how to use many tools such as 
len and range in python through the weekly assignment and I was also
able to get a lot of practice with working on different kinds of loops.
this week was very productive and I finished a lot of my assignments early
and I was able to use co pilot to help me with anything I didnt understand 
in the class.

there were many things i struggled with at first when I started like
making a basic menu loop using (while + if/elif/else, no functions) but
I had enoph resources online to help me undertand what information I was
lacking in order to solve the problems.
